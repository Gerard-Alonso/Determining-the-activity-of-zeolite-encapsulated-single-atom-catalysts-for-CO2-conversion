# Determining-the-activity-of-zeolite-encapsulated-single-atom-catalysts-for-CO2-conversion
This repository contains the geometries of all species in the CO2 --> CO + O reaction (i.e., CO2 as reactant, CO + O as product and the CO-O transition state) in the 29 TM1@MFI structures studied. First, each of the 29 TMs contain its own folder, which in turn has the "Reactant", "Product" and "Transition_State" folders with the VASP-compatible CONTCAR file.
